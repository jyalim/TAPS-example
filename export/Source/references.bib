    Advances in the volume, diversity, and complexity of research data
    and associated workflows requires enhanced capabilities to access,
    secure, reuse, process, analyze, understand, curate, share, and
    preserve data. To address this need at the regional level the
    University of Colorado, Colorado State University, and the
    University of Utah formed a "Cyberteam" in 2017 to provide
    cyberinfrastructure (CI) support to researchers at institutions in
    the Rocky Mountain Advanced Computing Consortium (RMACC)
    encompassing states across the Intermountain West. The Cyberteam is
    comprised of CI professionals across the three institutions who
    collaborate closely, sharing expertise and resources. Since its
    establishment, the Cyberteam has worked to broaden accessibility and
    options for computing, storage, and data publishing for RMACC
    researchers; enhance training on data- and workflow-oriented topics;
    improve engagement with researchers using CI; and better understand
    user needs and challenges. One key accomplishment has been the
    development of a series of focus group and survey instruments to
    achieve better understanding the CI needs and challenges of
    researchers across a diverse spectrum of disciplines. This paper
    provides an overview of the RMACC Cyberteam's objectives,
    accomplishments, challenges, and future direction.

    RMACC Summit is a heterogeneous supercomputer cluster with an
    aggregate floating point performance of 379 TFLOPS (Rmax, as
    currently configured) that provides about 85 million core-hours/year
    to researchers from institutions participating in the Rocky Mountain
    Advanced Computing Consortium (RMACC). The development of Summit was
    a collaborative effort toward specifying a system that meets the
    needs of researchers at multiple universities, and included
    implementation and testing of several new technologies.  We discuss
    our experiences in creating and maintaining a successful ongoing
    collaboration between the two universities that are RMACC Summit's
    primary operators, and consider both the technical and support
    challenges of extending that collaboration to other regional users.

    Users of high-performance computing systems face many challenges,
    particularly as they design and develop their software to run at
    multiple facilities. This can lead to a ``greatest common
    denominator" strategy that slows innovation and the adoption of
    newer techniques. In addition, these systems typically push the
    limits --- leading to problems with reliability and functionality of
    the system and software. We propose a consortium of HPC centers to
    collaborate on raising both the capability and the quality of the
    software for HPC systems.

    Computing has become an essential component of research and education
    for nearly every scientific discipline. Meeting the need for support
    staff who can help faculty make the best use of available computing
    resources is a significant challenge for small and mid-sized
    institutions. The NSF-sponsored Northeast Cyberteam is addressing this
    challenge by building a pool of research computing facilitators that
    can be shared across institutional boundaries while also developing
    self-service tools that reduce the support burden.

    In computing education, we have only just started developing methods
    for accurately measuring a student's understanding of introductory
    computing, let alone characterizing a whole classroom, school, or
    university system. As part of evaluating the impact of "Georgia
    Computes!" we sought an understanding the factors influencing
    undergraduate enrollment in introductory computing for an entire
    state in the United States of America. We gathered surveys from over
    1400 undergraduate students in introductory computing classes from
    19 higher-education institutions in a single state. The analysis
    provided insight into the impact of "Georgia Computes!", into the
    connections between stages of the computing education pathways, and
    how factors that influence students' pursuit of computing differ
    between genders and majority/minority group students.
